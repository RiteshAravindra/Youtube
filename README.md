# Youtube.com-Clone
Youtube Clone did this by using HTML, CSS, Javascript and RestApi. I tried to clone it exactly like real Youtube. Where you can search for videos and watch videos on full Screen.
 As a part of our Unit-3 assignment  .

erience in this Construction Week, this time Masai School give me and my team members an oppotunity to build a cloned website of Farfetch as a part of our Unit-3 construct week.

This was a group project executed within a 3 days of span.
